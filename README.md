# AZ_Map

A app used to document the generalized locations of every item in my Autozone because I got tired of having to ask where things were.

A simple mobile app developed using the Xamarin framework and C#. Developed a map image of the store where I work and hardcoded the coordinates of each index location into it because I didn't want to nuke my limited data. Due to being a hub store with over 2 million items, simply memorizing the locations was proving an arduous task, so I decided to develop a mobile app that other new employees could also benefit from.

TODO:
  * Pinch to Zoom. Does not work for reasons I haven't figured out.
  * A label of which zone the item is in that's always on screen so that it's easier to locate.
  * Finish adding every index.
